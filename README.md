# BattleShip

BattleShip is a project from my free time, to build a game from my own. My goal is to implement an App for smartphone. 

As I've never worked with Android App Developper, I decided to first develop it as an IntelliJ project, as my Programmierprojekt from university. I have different steps I want to do :
 - write a working app with client/server architectur of a battle ship, with one human player and one automata
 - translate it to an Android App project, set it online and let my sister test it. When working (maybe), open it to friends
 - make a 2 player version, of which the biggest challenge will be to find a way to connect 2 different players
 - make a 3 to 4 version. Each players set its ship on the same grid (server check that boats are not ovelapping), and each players can see its own boats as well as each targetet area, with the result. Maybe a team 2 to 2 players version
 - write a multilingual option
 - try an IA, and measure how much improvement it gives.

 - Implement other games, for exemple puissance 4, which challenge will be the IA (I don't see an easy and good implementation of an automata)
 
 - improve design, add sounds, better some features, add some, etc
